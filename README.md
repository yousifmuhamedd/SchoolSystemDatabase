# SchoolSystemDatabase
Database design for a school system
This project requires a database design that is suitable for school systems. It has to be efficient, redundant, and percise.

Information about student such as student ID, personal info, address, major, hours, etc. Other information about faculty staff, their schedules, departments, and courses they teach. Courses offered also should be assigned to certain departments, teachers, and semesters that these courses are offered in. All of these data are different from client to client as this database diagram supports more than one school. Grades are also calculated and assigned to the right student, to calculate their GPA.
